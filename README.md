# N# - The programming language
N# (N-Sharp) is a programming language developed with ease of creation in mind. It derives from a mix of C# and C++, but adds several new tools and completely rebuilds the libraries.

## What does it include?

This repository will come with documentation, a compiler, libraries, and extensions for popular IDEs to add the N# language to their portfolio.

## How will the language be executed?
N# is a compiled language. Using the built-in compiler, it will be converted into Assembly to then be run by the computer. Because of this, certain parts of the built-in libraries won't be able to be read fully in N# code, because some of it may include pure Assembly code.

## Why make/use this?
In my time as a programmer, I have seen many types of programming languages, but never a good language with useful libraries. For example, graphics libraries. C# is a beautiful and easy-to-use language (in my opinion), but you'll have trouble finding a good graphics library that works for C#, and if you find one, it's most likely a port of a library built for another language. C++, on the other hand, *does* have many commonly-used graphics libraries, but because it's syntax is so much more hard to use, I find it a lot harder to make good looking code in it.

N#'s goal is to fix that problem, with a good syntax system, along with many useful libraries, such as graphics and threading libraries, that come with the language and compiler.

Since it is just me working on this, and as a side project, no doubt this will take a long time. But I believe that it's something that could prove very useful if I actually finish it, and I hope you agree.
